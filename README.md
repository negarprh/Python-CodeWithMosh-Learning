# Python Course: Coding With Mosh 

This repository contains my progress as I learn Python through the [Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/p/python-programming-course-beginners) course. The code is organized by sections of the course, with each folder representing a specific topic covered.

## Sections Completed

1. **Variables**  
   Basics of working with variables in Python, including types, naming conventions, and operations.

2. **Control Flow**  
   Understanding conditional statements and loops, including `if`, `else`, `elif`, `for`, and `while`.

3. **Functions**  
   Make Functions, Arguments and types of Functions

## Purpose

This repository serves as my personal learning log and a way to practice coding while following the tutorials. Feel free to explore the code as I gradually build up my Python skills.

## How to Use

- Each folder corresponds to a section from the course.
- Clone the repository and navigate through the directories to view or run the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/negarprh/Python-CodingWithMosh-Learning.git
```

## What's Next?

I will continue adding new sections as I progress through the course. Stay tuned for more!
