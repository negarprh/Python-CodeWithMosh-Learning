# Python Learning Journey with Mosh

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! üöÄ This repository is a testament to my dedication to mastering Python, following the **[Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/p/python-programming-course-beginners)** course. Each folder represents a structured section, showcasing my persistence in understanding and applying every concept.

## üìå Why This Repository?
This is more than just code. it's a **roadmap** of my growth. I believe in **consistent learning, hands-on practice, and pushing through challenges**. Through this repo, I document my progress and reinforce my knowledge with real code implementations.

## üìñ Topics Covered So Far

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Variables
- Understanding data types, naming conventions, and variable operations.
- Writing clean and structured Python code.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Control Flow
- Mastering conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
- Implementing logical and comparison operators.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Functions
- Defining reusable functions and understanding different argument types.
- Debugging techniques and best practices for function design.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structures
- Exploring **lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets**, and their operations.
- Using list/dictionary comprehensions, filtering, mapping, and lambdas.
- Implementing stacks, queues, and other essential data structures.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) *In Progress*
- Diving into **classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation**.
- Writing modular and reusable code with OOP principles.

## üí° How to Use This Repository
- Browse through the folders‚Äîeach represents a structured topic.
- Clone the repo to follow along and run the examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/negarprh/Python-CodeWithMosh-Learning.git
```

## üöÄ What's Next?
I'm committed to mastering Python **step by step**, ensuring I understand not just the syntax but also best practices. As I progress, I‚Äôll add:
- **Advanced Python concepts** (OOP, decorators, generators, file handling, etc.).
- **Real-world projects** to apply my skills practically.
- **Data structures & algorithms** for stronger problem-solving abilities.

## üì¢ Follow My Journey!
